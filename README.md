*Reason for choosing dataset/model:* I picked this tweet_eval dataset(https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweet_eval) and distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english (https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) model because I've been planning to work on a project examining how the public feels about political party leaders based on tweets until the next election. Therefore, with these tasks, I was able to go over NLP analysis techniques generally used for tweets and experiment with sentiment analysis"
